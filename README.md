Developed a robotic arm programmed to autonomously solder a PCB, using Matlab, Arduino, DC motors, Webcam and an OWI robotic arm.
Implemented precise detection of soldering spots via enhanced image processing by applying Computer Vision developed in Matlab. Inverse kinematics and workspace analysis used to convert co-ordinates to joint angles.
Integrated a feedback mechanism using potentiometers installed on the 3D printed gears mounted on the joints.
89% accuracy achieved by leveraging feedback from potentiometers and ultimately simulating stabilized arm motion by precision-controlled motor speed.
